            Are sheep blind? Most assuredly, they are not. However, their fashion sense would 
            seem to say otherwise. To find out what shearing can

            This primate doesn’t like you. He thinks you&#39;re ugly and smelly, and he wants 
            you to know just how much he disapproves of the human species. <a href="#">Click 
            here</a> to find out just what this primate has to say and why.

            Can you name this species? I can't. We are offering a million dollar reward for the 
            person that can accurately name the species, and tell us what the primate above said to
            him just before he gave that chagrined look.

            Who knew bears, with such a great sense of smell, would like to eat the smelly feet 
            of humans? I can't imagine why you'd want to know more about this topic, but if you do,
            here's the rest of the story.
